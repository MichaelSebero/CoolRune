# We can override the default for a specific service
# by appending the service name (FILES, YP, NISPLUS, LDAP).

# For local files, use a more secure hash. We

# For NIS, we should always use DES:

# is prepended by the name of the crypt hash). In case of blowfish
# and sha* this is the number of rounds
